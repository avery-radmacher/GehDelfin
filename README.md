# GehDelfin
GehDelfin is a port of [Delfin](https://github.com/avery-radmacher/Delfin) to the Go programming language. There were several motivations to create such a port:
* To learn the Go programming language
* To develop a command-prompt-friendly version of the app
* To take advantage of Go's concurrency primitives
* To develop a native executable without the fluff of a big .NET application

In keeping with the spirit of Delfin, the name GehDelfin comes from German, translating as the command "Go, Dolphin" (spoken to a dolphin peer).

GehDelfin is under sporadic development, porting Delfin functionality in bits and pieces until it is ready to take on a life of its own.
